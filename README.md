# Nzb Dav

NzbDav is a WebDAV server that allows you to mount and browse NZB documents as a virtual file system without downloading. It's designed to integrate with other media management tools, like Sonarr and Radarr, by providing a SABnzbd-compatible API. With it, you can build an infinite Plex or Jellyfin media library that streams directly from your usenet provider at maxed-out speeds, without using any storage space on your own server.

Check the video below for a demo:

# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by using the official Docker image.

To try it out, run the following command to pull and run the image with port `3000` exposed:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 nzbdav/nzbdav:latest
```

And if you would like to persist saved settings, attach a volume at `/config`

```
mkdir -p $(pwd)/nzbdav && \
docker run --rm -it \
  -v $(pwd)/nzbdav:/config \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  nzbdav/nzbdav:latest
```
After starting the container, be sure to navigate to the Settings page on the UI to finish setting up your usenet connection settings.

You'll also want to set up a username and password for logging in to the webdav server

* **Docker Compose:** Full stack with Rclone sidecar and healthchecks.
* **Single-Container / Embedded Rclone:** Run rclone inside the NzbDav container for `docker run`-only platforms (Unraid, Portainer, TrueNAS).
* **Performance Tuning:** Benchmarking WebDAV connection limits.
* **Integrations:** Automating Radarr/Sonarr queue management and repairs.

# Special Thanks

* Many thanks to [@g0ldyy](https://github.com/g0ldyy), who kindly reported an auth-bypass vulnerability in nzbdav on 2026-03-17.
  * The vulnerability affected versions 0.2.46 through 0.6.1
  * The dockerhub and ghcr images for these versions have since been patched, rebuilt, and republished as of 2026-03-18.
  * Simply **repull whichever image tag you are using to ensure your instance is patched.**
  * To confirm a patched version is running, look for a `+260317` suffix on the version displayed in nzbdav ui (example image below)
  * This is especially important if your instance is public facing and not behind vpn/sso.
