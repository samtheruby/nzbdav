# Comprehensive NzbDav Setup Guide

This guide is an opinionated, step-by-step walkthrough to setting up NzbDav for maximum performance ("infinite library" style) with Radarr, Sonarr, Plex/Jellyfin and Stremio.

## How the "Infinite Library" Works
Before configuring, it helps to understand the flow:

### Path A: The Automation Flow (Radarr/Sonarr + Plex/Jellyfin)
1. **Radarr** sends an `.nzb` file to NzbDav (acting as a download client) to "download".
2. **NzbDav** mounts the nzb onto the webdav without actually downloading it.
3. **NzbDav** tells Radarr the "download" is finished and points to a folder of **Symlinks** at `/mnt/remote/nzbdav/completed-symlinks`.
    * The **Symlinks** always point to the `/mnt/remote/nzbdav/.ids` folder which contains the streamable content.
4. **Radarr** imports these Symlinks into your library. For eg: `/mnt/media/movies`.
5. **Plex** reads the Symlink -> Rclone Mount -> WebDAV Stream -> Usenet Provider.
    * **RClone** will make the nzb contents available to your filesystem by streaming, without using any storage space on your server.

### Path B: The On-Demand Flow (Stremio)
1. **Stremio (via AIOStreams)** searches your indexers using the `Newznab` addon and finds a release.
2. **AIOStreams** sends the `.nzb` to NzbDav's API to mount it.
3. **NzbDav** mounts the file instantly via WebDAV.
4. **AIOStreams** generates a streamable URL.
   * *Note: If using the recommended Proxy setup, this URL points to AIOStreams, which tunnels the traffic from NzbDav.*
5. **Stremio** plays the video from that URL (bypassing Rclone/Symlinks entirely).

## Phase 1: Prerequisites

### 1. Usenet Provider
You need an usenet provider to download content. Consult the [Usenet Providers Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/providerdeals/) for a full list.

### 2. Indexers
You need usenet indexers to find content. Consult the [Usenet Indexers Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/indexers/) for a full list.

Add these to Prowlarr and sync them to your Radarr/Sonarr instances.

---

## Phase 2: Initial Deployment

We start with a basic NzbDav container.

### 1. `docker-compose.yml` (Part 1)

Create the file structure like below:
```
your-root-docker-folder/
├── apps
│   ├── nzbdav
│   │   └── docker-compose.yml   👈 Create this file now
│   └── ...
```

Update `PUID`, `PGID`, `TZ`, and volume paths as needed.
You can get your PUID/PGID by running `id` in your terminal.

```yaml
services:
  nzbdav:
    image: nzbdav/nzbdav:latest
    container_name: nzbdav
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
      # Check every 1 minute
      interval: 1m
      # If it fails 3 times (3 minutes total), restart it
      retries: 3
      # Give it 5 seconds to boot up
      start_period: 5s
      # If it doesn't answer in 5 seconds, assume it's frozen
      timeout: 5s
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      # Change these IDs to match your Docker user that you got from above
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /mnt:/mnt
```

Run the container
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Core Configuration

Navigate to `http://your-server-ip:3000`.

**A. Create Admin Account**

Set your username and password.

**B. Usenet Settings (`Settings` > `Usenet`)**

* **Host:** `news.newshosting.com` (put your provider here).
* **Port:** `563`
* **Username / Password:** Your Usenet creds.
* **Max Connections:** `100` (Set to your provider's max allowed).
* **Type:** `Pool Connections`.
* **Use SSL:** Checked.

**C. WebDAV Settings (`Settings` > `WebDAV`)**

* **Set WebDAV Password:** Create a password (you will need this for Rclone).
* **Enforce Read-Only:** Uncheck it if you'd like to delete files from terminal. Otherwise, leave it checked.

### 3. Speed Tuning (Optional)

_Note: The default Max Download Connections setting of `15` works perfectly for most users (handling ~1Gbps). You only need to touch this if you are experiencing speed issues._

You can find the optimal **Max Download Connections** for your network (`Settings > WebDAV > Max Download Connections`) using the steps below:

1. **Baseline Test:** Run this on your server to check raw bandwidth.
   ```bash
   wget -O /dev/null https://ash-speed.hetzner.com/10GB.bin --report-speed=bits
   ```
2. **NzbDav Internal Test:**
   * In one Terminal window, run below command to monitor CPU usage:
     ```bash
     docker stats nzbdav
     ```
   * Download a movie `.nzb` via your indexer website and upload it to NzbDav.
   * In NzbDav UI: Go to `Dav Explore` > `Content` > `Movies` > Pick the movie you just downloaded > Right click the **video file** and click `Copy Link Address`. Now paste it in a text editor where you can see the whole thing.
   * Now construct test command like below and run it in another terminal window:
     ```bash
     docker exec nzbdav sh -c "apk add --no-cache wget > /dev/null 2>&1 && timeout 20s wget -O /dev/null --report-speed=bits --progress=bar:force:noscroll 'http://localhost:8080/view/content/Movies/<Movie Folder>/<Movie Name>.mkv?downloadKey=<download-key>'"
     ```
     Take a look at the speed it reports and also notice the CPU usage of the container.
3. **Adjust & Repeat:**
   * Set `Max Download Connections` to `10`. Test speed. (e.g., 500Mbps @ 70% CPU)
   * Set `Max Download Connections` to `15`. Test speed. (e.g., 1Gbps @ 85% CPU)
   * *Sweet Spot:* Stop when speed plateaus. For me, **15** (the default value) was the magic number.

## Phase 3: The Full Stack (Rclone Sidecar)

Now we mount the NzbDav web dav to the host file system using a sidecar container.

> **Running on a single-container platform** (Unraid, Portainer single-container, TrueNAS apps) where `docker compose` sidecars are awkward? You can run rclone *inside* the NzbDav container instead — skip to [Alternative: Embedded Rclone Mount](#alternative-embedded-rclone-mount-single-container).

### 1. Prepare Host Directory

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/remote/nzbdav # Create mount folder
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) -R /mnt/remote/nzbdav # Give ownership of the folder to your user
```

### 2. Generate Rclone Config

```
your-root-docker-folder/
├── apps
│   ├── nzbdav
│   │   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   │   └── rclone.conf          👈 Create this empty file now
│   └── ...
```

*Generate obscured password:* `docker run --rm -it rclone/rclone obscure "<the-webdav-password-you-set-in-nzbdav-earlier>"`

Now populate `rclone.conf` with:
```ini
[nzbdav]
type = webdav
url = http://nzbdav:3000/
vendor = other
user = admin
pass = <PASTE_OBSCURED_PASSWORD_HERE_WITHOUT_ANGLE_BRACKETS>
```

### 3. Update `docker-compose.yml`

Add the Rclone sidecar service to your existing `apps/nzbdav/docker-compose.yml`.

Update `PUID`, `PGID`, `TZ`, and volume paths as needed.
You can get your PUID/PGID by running `id` in your terminal.

```yaml
nzbdav_rclone:
  image: rclone/rclone:latest
  container_name: nzbdav_rclone
  restart: unless-stopped
  environment:
    # Change these IDs to match your Docker user that you got from above
    - PUID=1000
    - PGID=1000
    # Set the time zone to match your location
    - TZ=America/New_York
  volumes:
    # Host Path : Container Path : Propagation
    - /mnt:/mnt:rshared
    - ./rclone.conf:/config/rclone/rclone.conf
  cap_add:
    - SYS_ADMIN
  security_opt:
    - apparmor:unconfined
  devices:
    - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse:rwm
  depends_on:
    nzbdav:
      condition: service_healthy
      restart: true
  # Optimized mounting flags for streaming
  # 0M buffer size prevents double-caching (Kernel + RClone)
  # 512M read-ahead ensures smooth playback
  command: >
    mount nzbdav: /mnt/remote/nzbdav
      --uid=1000
      --gid=1000
      --allow-other
      --links
      --use-cookies
      --vfs-cache-mode=full
      --vfs-cache-max-size=20G
      --vfs-cache-max-age=24h
      --buffer-size=0M
      --vfs-read-ahead=512M
      --dir-cache-time=20s
```

Start `nzbdav_rclone`
```bash
$ docker compose up -d nzbdav_rclone
```

If you make some rclone config changes or other changes in the compose file, apply the changes like this
```bash
$ docker compose up -d --force-recreate nzbdav_rclone
```

Check out the mount is working
```bash
ls -la /mnt/remote/nzbdav
# Should show: .ids, completed-symlinks, content, nzbs
```

#### Understanding the Flags
* **`--links`**: **Crucial**. This allows `*.rclonelink` files within the webdav to be translated to symlinks when mounted onto your filesystem.
  > *Note: Requires Rclone v1.70.3+.*
* **`--use-cookies`**: **Performance**. Without this, Rclone re-authenticates on every single request, causing massive slowdowns.
* **`--allow-other`**: **Permissions**. Ensures other containers (like Radarr/Plex) can see the mounted files.
* **`--vfs-cache-mode=full`**: **Performance**. Enables the full VFS cache, which is required for seeking and proper file handling.
* **`--buffer-size 0M`**: **Stability**. Prevents double-caching (RAM + Disk). 
* **`--vfs-read-ahead=512M`**: **Smooth Playback**. Buffers 512MB into VFS disk cache ahead of the current position to handle high-bitrate spikes without stuttering.
* **`--vfs-cache-max-size=20G`**: **Disk Management**. Limits the local disk space used by the cache. Adjust based on your available storage.
* **`--dir-cache-time=20s`**: **Responsiveness**. Keeps the directory cache short so new downloads/links appear quickly in the mount.

These flags are optimized for streaming. 

Remember: `unnecessary flags = potential pitfalls`.

## Alternative: Embedded Rclone Mount (Single Container)

Instead of the sidecar above, NzbDav can run rclone itself, in the same container. This
is aimed at platforms that only support a single `docker run` (Unraid Community Apps,
Portainer single-container, TrueNAS apps), where wiring up a separate rclone service is
painful. The rclone binary ships inside the NzbDav image.

> **This does not remove the privileged-container requirements.** A FUSE mount still needs
> `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN`, `--device /dev/fuse`, `--security-opt apparmor:unconfined`, and —
> for other containers (Plex/Radarr) to see the mount — a shared bind mount such as
> `/mnt:/mnt:rshared`. What you save is the second container, the manual `rclone.conf`, the
> `rclone obscure` step, and the `depends_on` ordering.

### 1. How the mount authenticates

In embedded mode, the **`WEBDAV_PASSWORD`** environment variable is the **single source** for
the WebDAV password. NzbDav uses it both for the WebDAV server's own authentication and for the
embedded mount (obscured and handed to rclone via the environment — never written to disk or
shown on the command line). To avoid a second, conflicting source, the WebDAV password field in
the UI is **disabled** while the embedded mount is enabled. Set the password here, on the
`docker run` line, instead.

### 2. Run it

```bash
mkdir -p $(pwd)/nzbdav
docker run -d \
  --name nzbdav \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -e WEBDAV_PASSWORD=your-webdav-password \
  -e RCLONE_MOUNT=true \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  --device /dev/fuse \
  --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/nzbdav:/config \
  -v /mnt:/mnt:rshared \
  nzbdav/nzbdav:latest
```

* `RCLONE_MOUNT=true` turns the embedded mount on from first boot. You can also toggle it
  later under `Settings` > `Rclone Server` > **Enable Embedded Rclone Mount** (the UI toggle
  takes over once set).
* The mount target defaults to `/mnt/nzbdav`; change it under `Settings` > `SABnzbd` >
  **Rclone Mount Directory** (or the same field in the Rclone tab).
* **Permissions:** the container runs as `PUID:PGID`, so that user must be able to create and
  write the mount directory. If the parent (e.g. host `/mnt`) is owned by root, pre-create and
  chown it first, otherwise the mount fails (the status badge will report it):
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nzbdav && sudo chown 1000:1000 /mnt/nzbdav
  ```

### 3. Configure the mount options

Open `Settings` > `Rclone Server`. With the embedded mount enabled you can tune the same
streaming options as the sidecar — cache mode, cache size/age, buffer size, read-ahead,
dir-cache-time, log level, plus an **Additional Flags** box for anything else. The required
flags (`--links`, `--use-cookies`, `--allow-other`) are always applied for you, and the
rclone RC cache-refresh integration is wired automatically (no host/user/pass to fill in).

Changes apply live — saving the settings restarts the embedded mount with the new flags; no
container restart needed.

### 4. Migrating an existing library from a sidecar

If you're switching an **existing** setup from the external rclone sidecar to the embedded
mount, and the embedded mount uses a **different** path than the sidecar did, your library's
symlinks still point at the old path and will break. (If you instead set the embedded mount
directory to the *same* path the sidecar used, everything keeps working and you can skip this.)

NzbDav can repoint them for you. **Do this in order:**

1. Enable the embedded mount (new path, e.g. `/mnt/nzbdav`) and confirm the status badge under
   `Settings` > `Rclone Server` shows **Mounted**. Leave the old sidecar running for now.
2. **Back up your library directory.**
3. Go to `Settings` > `Maintenance` > **Migrate Library to Embedded Mount**, enter the old
   sidecar path (e.g. `/mnt/remote/nzbdav`), and run it. It rewrites every library symlink that
   pointed under the old path to the same content under the new mount, showing live progress.
4. Verify a few titles play from your library.
5. Remove the old rclone sidecar — nothing references it anymore.

This only applies to **symlink**-strategy libraries; `.strm` users are unaffected (their links
don't embed the mount path). The task is safe to re-run and is a no-op on a fresh install.

## Phase 4: Integrations

### 1. Add NzbDav Download Client to Radarr/Sonarr

Go to Radarr/Sonarr > `Settings` > `Download Clients` > `Add Download Client`

* Client: **SABnzbd**
* Name: `NzbDav`
* Host: `nzbdav` 
* Port: `3000`
* API Key: Found in NzbDav `Settings` > `SABnzbd`.

### 2. Configure NzbDav for Radarr/Sonarr

Go to NzbDav `Settings` > `Radarr/Sonarr`.

1. **Radarr Instances > Add**
   * **Host:** `http://radarr:7878`
   * **API Key:** (Radarr > Settings > General > Security > API Key)
2. **Sonarr Instances > Add**
   * **Host:** `http://sonarr:8989`
   * **API Key:** (Sonarr > Settings > General > Security > API Key)
3. **Automatic Queue Management:**

   Configure these rules to handle failed or bad releases, keeping your queue clean with as little manual intervention as possible. 
   Feel free to experiment and adjust these rules to your liking.

   * **Do Nothing:**
       * Found matching series via grab history, but release was matched to series by ID. Automatic import is not possible.
       * Found matching movie via grab history, but release was matched to movie by ID. Manual Import required.
       * Episode was not found in the grabbed release.
       * Episode was unexpected considering the folder name.
       * Invalid season or episode.
       * Unable to determine if file is a sample.
   * **Remove, Blocklist, and Search:**
       * No files found are eligible for import.
       * No audio tracks detected.
       * Sample.
   * **Remove and Blocklist:**
       * Not an upgrade for existing episode file(s).
       * Not an upgrade for existing movie file.
       * Not a Custom Format upgrade.
   * **Remove:**
       * Episode file already imported.

### 3. Configure Mount & Repairs

1. **Mount Directory (`Settings` > `SABnzbd`):**
   * **Rclone Mount Directory:** `/mnt/remote/nzbdav`
   * *Note: This tells NzbDav where the files physically exist on your host system so it can pass the correct path to Radarr/Sonarr.*
2. **Repairs (`Settings` > `Repairs`):**
   * **Library Directory:** `/mnt/media`
     *(Point this to the root folder where your actual Movie/TV libraries live on the host)*.
   * **Enable Background Repairs:** Checked.
     *(This allows NzbDav to monitor for dead links in your library and trigger redownloads automatically).*
